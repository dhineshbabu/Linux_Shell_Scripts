: Interface between hardware and software
Shell: Interface between users and kernels (operating system) echo $0 will return the type of shell ( in centos it will return 'bash')
	cat /etc/shells to get the list of shells

cat /etc/passwd  => to check what's the shell assigned to your usedr name

Types of shells:
----------------
Gnome (GUI)
KDE (GUI)
sh (command line)
bash (command line)
csh and tcsh (command line)
ksh (command line)

Starting a shell:
-----------------
simply type the shell name

centos uses gnome for GUI and bash for command line

type sh to go to the sh shell
type exit to go back to bash again

Running a shell script:
-----------------------
give absolute path
or ./scriptname (relative path)

Shell scripting standards:
--------------------------

Naming convention:
Create a scripts directory
Script name should identify function
Script extension should be .shell (if multiple shells are available)

Script File Permission:
-------------------------
user-group-others
rwxr-xr-xr-x

To change permissions:
(e.g) chmod a+x scriptname

shell script Format:
--------------------
Define shell (#!/bin/bash)
comments (#) => give description about the script
Define variables
commands
Statments (if, while, for etc.)

Script runs from top to bottom


Basic Shell Scripts:
---------------------
su - => will change to root user

$ used for variables
'read' to get the user input
hostname
use `` to use variables in echo

we can use -eq or == for comparison

sleep to make the script  wait for specified seconds

Exit Status:
------------
0 - OK
1 - MInor problkem
2 - Serious Trouble
3-255  -  everything else

echo $? -> to check my previous command was successful (we will get 0 if it is successful)

ping 192.168.1.1

/dev/null is a file in linux (like  a dummy file). if we write anything to thius file, it will disappear

Creating cron jobs:
-------------------
crontab -e
crontab -l => to view the contents of crontab

34 20 * * * /home/adminuser/scripts/advanced_scripts/03_ping_script | mail -s :Connectivity Status" dhinesh
lovesyou@gmail.com

Creating files with older timestamps: touch -d "Thu, 1 March 2018 12:30:00" a
Finding files with older timestamps: find /home/adminuser/scripts/advanced_scripts -mtime +90 -exec ls -l {} \;
Deleting files with older timestamps: find /home/adminuser/scripts/advanced_scripts -mtime +90 -exec rm {} \;
Rename old files files with older timestamps: find /home/adminuser/scripts/advanced_scripts -mtime +90 -exec mv {} {}.old \;


Taking backup: tar -cvf /tmp/backup.tar /var
To compress: gzip /tmp/backup.tar


grep -c adminuser /etc/passwd  => to get the search count

lsit of users logged in recently can be seen by 'last'  command

nohup ./15_loggertail &  => to run the loger from backend


/etc/passwd qill have active users
/etc/shadow will have disabled users

Kill the process with name "Sleep 600":  ps -ef | grep "sleep 600" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I{} kill {}

Disk space: df -h | egrep -v "tmpfs|devtmpfs" | tail -n+2
df -h | egrep -v "tmpfs|devtmpfs" | tail -n+2 | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d'%' -f1

ls -l file* | wc -l

Read more about 'sed' command

Use "Bridged Adapter' in Oracle VirtualBox if you are using putty 


Important Information:
----------------------
"root" is a super administrative account in Linux ('su -' in centos and 'sudo -s' in ubuntu)
Linux is a case sensitive system
Avoid using files names with spaces in it

Linux File Types:(based on the first letter in the output of ls -l)
-----------------
- Regularfile
d Directory
l link
c Special File or device files socket
p Named pipe
b Block device

WildCards:
-----------
* - represents zero or more characters
? - represents a single character
[] - represents a range of characters

Soft links vs Hard links:
-------------------------
inode = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
softlink =  Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed
Hard link = Deleting , renaming or movinh the original file will not affect the hard link
ln filename => hasd link
ln -s filename => softlink

File Ownership:
---------------
There are 2 owners for a file or directory:
user and group

chown - to change ownership of the file
chgrp - to change the group ownership of a file

User -R for recursive ownership

Combining and Splitting files:
-------------------------------
cat file1 file2 file3 > file 4

split -l 300 file.txt output  (output will be outputaa outputab outputac and etc.)

Editors in Linux:
------------------
vi - standard text editor
ed - standard line editor
ex - Extended line editor
emacs - A full screen editor

sed command:
-------------
Replaces a string in a file with a newstring
Find and delete a line
Removes empty lines
Removes first line or n linesTo replace tabs with spaces
show defined lines from a file
Substitute within vi editor
and etc.

sed 's/africa/London/g' input.txt => this will not change the actual file
use -i to permenantly write the changes: sed -i 's/africa/London/g' input.txt

sed 's/London//g' input.txt => to remove the text

Network File System (NFS):
--------------------------
Developed by Sun Micro Systems

Server side:

#Assign Permissions
mkdir /sample
chmod a+rwx /sample

/sample 192.168.12.7(rw,sync,no_root_squash) = for only 1 host ip is client id assress

exportfs -rv

Linux Performance Issues:
-------------------------
diskspace: df -h
du -ah | sort -nr

top - to see top statistics of resource utilization

free -m => to check the memory status

cat /proc/meminfo 

vmstat

pmap processid

dmidecode | more => info about the hardware, vendor and etc.

lscpu => to get cpu architectuire info

cat /proc/cpuinfo => similar to lscpu

iostat - disk status

iostat -y s

tcpdump -i eth0

lsof -i -P -n | grep -i listen  => to get the listeneing ports

ss -plnt => similar to netstat
 
iftop (yum install epel-release && yum install iftop) => to check the data transfer from / to the system
